# CI Status

Create a widget to use on some of our documentation process.

This will display color dots Critical, Major, Minor, and None along with the description of the status. 
If you want to read more about the status click on the link to the Circle Status page. 

Includes a date and time which at this point is UTC time not Eastern time.

This color is for a <span style="color:#e74c3c">Critical</span> issue.

This color is for a <span style="color:#e67e22">Major</span>  issue.

This color is for a <span style="color:#f1c40f">Minor</span> issue.

This color is for a <span style="color:#2ecc71">None</span> issue.
